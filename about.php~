	echo "Set up in 2011 by a group of first years, CompSocks is a technology society in its infancy.<br/>
	      We aim to encourage all things related to computing, software, gaming, security and electronics, in social and fun ways.<br/>
	      We also aim to make all labs at City University a lot less productive.<br/>
	      Over the course of the past year, we've held a cryptoparty, several lan parties and a tour to Facebook London.<br/>
	      For details of all our past events, please see <a href=\"#\">events past</a><br/>
	      In the future we'd like to run a DefCon, several more lan parties, tours and trips.<br/>
	      If you're interested in working with us, please <a href=\"#\">contact us</a>";
